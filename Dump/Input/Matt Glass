 Matt Glass is a musician / filmmaker living in Los Angeles. He received his Masters of Fine Art degree from the Cranbrook Academy Of Art. He is also known to eat Lucky Charms cereal from a glass, without milk.


== Video ==
Over the last few years, Matt Glass has created a handful of strange puppeted and animated short films. In Testeron (2010), Two hand puppets play out an iconic husband and wife sitcom scene which gives way to a desert landscape, an obscene gesture, and a slow-moving turtle. In Blank Sign (2011) a self-important artist figure drives his car through the night, telling an unknown listener over the phone about his great artistic breakthrough.
In 2012, Matt released Citadel, a monochromatic puppet-filled short film inspired by cerebral horror films of the 1970s. The film's plot has been summarized as follows:

Experience the monochromatic life of a gentleman puppet as he navigates office furniture, elevators and a burning childhood all confined within a maze of floors in a bottomless skyscraper. Like a vertical timeline, each floor represents a different point in his life. With the aid of an off-kilter elevator operator, he journeys though his life with the horrors of his past following closely behind.

Matt has directed music videos for bands such as The Statuettes, Rotten Musicians and Timeflies. The 2014 puppet-filled video he directed for Imperial Mammoth's song Fifty-Five Fires was described as "film noir with puppets"
Half Cut Tea, a documentary web series created by Glass and fellow Cranbrook Academy of Art graduate Jordan Wayne Long, premiered online in early 2013. Its three seasons consists of 20 episodes highlighting artists from across the country.

... a database for people to discover and become inspired by talented individuals who they were acquainted with or had heard of through friends.

In late 2014, Matt along with Sandeep Parikh, Adam Catino and Jordan Long, began making comedy short films for Sandeep's EffinFunny channel. During this time, Matt wrote and directed Good Morning, a musical, short film featuring singing puppets and a brutal crime.
In 2015, Matt Glass and Jordan Wayne Long started the production company HCT.media. Their clients have included The Jim Henson Company, BBC, NPR, KCET, LINK TV and more. Shorts that have garnered attention include The History of Asteroids and the Advancement of Science and Procopius.


== Music ==
Matt Glass was the drummer of The Brobecks from 2003-2005. In addition to playing drums in the band, he recorded and mixed their two first albums Understanding The Brobecks and Happiest Nuclear Winter. In 2005, he left the band to pursue his degree in Photography. Since then, he has performed with and recorded several bands including Michael Gross and The Statuettes and The Lazy Waves.
In 2010, Matt played drums, keyboards and produced a cover of the Little Shop of Horrors song Skid Row(Downtown) with Dallon Weekes of The Brobecks, featuring additional vocals from Brendon Urie and guitar by Ian Crawford.
His music has been featured on various television programs on NBC, FX and more.


=== Discography ===


== Photography ==
Matt Glass is known for his narrative, cinematic photographic style. His work ranges from comical and sarcastic to horrific and violent. Matt has been featured in several magazine and was an honorable mention in American Photo's Images Of The Year competition in 2007  and 2008 
In 2009, Matt exhibited his Apocrypha series of photographs. The visual style in this series is inspired by Baroque Art as well as modern cinematic lighting. In his artist statement, he describes the work:

Each photograph represents a different narrative, but they all take place in the same apocalyptic world. In this world, an unknown event has left humanity in ruin. The source of the violence and destruction is never seen. The human reaction to this apocalypse is the focus.

In 2010, Matt exhibited his series, The Origin of Waking. In it, he supplements his photographs with music. Each image has a corresponding song.

... listening to the music can expand on the imagery of the photograph without spelling out exactly what is happening and what it might mean ... The songs don't have specifics, just moods.
