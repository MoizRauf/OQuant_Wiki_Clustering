 Duncan Chessell (born 1970 in Adelaide) is an Australian explorer, mountain guide, geologist and photographer who has reached the seven highest summits in each of the world's seven continents 
Duncan has been climbing since 1988, guiding since 1994 and has climbed and guided on all seven continents. He started out on the crags and in the gorges of National Parks of Australia, then moved on to larger mountains around the world. He is one of few Australian mountaineers to have climbed and guided Mt Everest and the equal first South Australian to summit. He has also guided Cho Oyu successfully twice. He was also a member of the first Australian ascent of Makalu, the 5th highest peak in the world. In New Zealand he has climbed technically hard (grade six) routes and is one summit away from completing all the 3000m peaks in New Zealand. He has also climbed the fabled Seven Summits and is one of only about a dozen guides to have led expeditions to all of the Seven Summits. In 2006 Duncan worked with a group of young people with cancer known as CanTeen, guiding them to climb Mt Kilimanjaro. He founded DCXP Mountain Journeys Pty Ltd which he ran for over a decade guiding the seven summits including guiding Mt Everest commercially and summiting Mt Everest three times. Other destinations included the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea which his company DCXP guided thousands of Australian Trekkers over between 2003 and 2010.  He was a member of the NZMGA. In 2010 Duncan sold DCXP to Katie Sarah, also a seven summiter, and shifted back into the field of geology and became the Managing Director of the public company Endeavour Discoveries Ltd. Endeavour is a mineral exploration company based in South Australia exploring for base and precious metals such as Nickel and Gold in South Australia and the Northern Territory. In 2011 he became the Chairman of Endeavour Discoveries Ltd. In 2014 Duncan co-founded the Himalayan Development Foundation Australia Inc (HDFA) an organisation dedicated the helping children in a Nepal get a start in life via a decent education. The HDFA has raised over A$$100,000 in its first year and built a boarding school in Nepal with some of the proceeds in the remote Kanchenjunga region of East Nepal.
