Greek Plan
The Greek Plan or Greek Project is an early solution to the Eastern Question which was advanced by Catherine the Great in the early 1780s. It envisaged the partition of the Ottoman Empire between the Russian and Habsburg Empires followed by the restoration of the Byzantine Empire centered in Constantinople.


== Outline ==
Like her predecessors, Catherine concerned herself with the Orthodox Christians under Ottoman rule; she also sponsored the Orlov Revolt in the Morea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, and invited many Greeks like Ioannis Varvakis to settle in Russia, mainly in Crimea and New Russia. She conceived that one of her grandsons, appropriately named Constantine, would become the first emperor of the restored Byzantium. Another important consideration was Russia's goal of free access to the Mediterranean Sea through the Bosphorus, which the Ottomans controlled.
For this plan to succeed, the Great European Powers would need to agree to it and the Danube powers to cooperate. In May 1780, Catherine arranged a secret meeting with Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, in Mogilyov. In a series of letters from September 1781, Catherine and Joseph discussed their plans to partition the Ottoman Empire and restore the Byzantine Empire. The Austro-Russian alliance was formalized in May 1781.
The Greek Plan was masterminded by Prince Potemkin who gave Greek names to the newly founded towns in New Russia (e.g., Odessa and Kherson). Byzantine symbolism was highlighted in new churches such as Kherson Cathedral. Another meeting of the Russian and Austrian monarchs was arranged as part of Catherine's Crimean journey of 1787. Both countries declared war on the Ottoman Empire later that year. Joseph's death in 1790, followed by the Treaty of Jassy and the Treaty of Sistova, in which Austria gained little, effectively ended the agreement.


== Cities named in Greek during this period ==

The following major cities got the names styled in Greek during this period. Some of them were new, others were renamed.
Kherson (1778), after Chersonesus
Eupatoria (1784), from Eupator: Ευ·πατωρ "(of) noble father", after Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose dominions included Crimea
Mariupol (1780), after Maria Feodorovna
Melitopol (1784, renamed 1842 after Melita (ancient port city) which existed in the vicinity)
Nikolaev (1789, after St. Nicholas: Νίκη; Níkē, "victory" and λαός; laós, "people")
Nikopol (renamed so in 1786 after Nike, the goddess of victory)
Ovidiopol (1793) after Ovidius
Sevastopol (1784)
Simferopol (1784)
Stavropol (1777)
Tiraspol (1792, renamed 1895, after Tyras (Τύρας) for Dniester)
Odessa (1795, after Odessos, thought to be located in the vicinity)
There was an attempt to rename Stary Krym into Levkopol (Leukopolis, "White City"), but the name never gained popularity.

Staphylococcus nepalensisStaphylococcus nepalensis is a Gram-positive coccoid bacterium belonging to the genus Staphylococcus.


== History ==
This species was first isolated from the respiratory tract of goats in 2003.


== Description ==
The bacteria are nonmotile, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, Gram-positive cocci, 1.1 to 1.6 μm in diameter, that occur singly, in pairs, and in irregular clusters. The G+C content of the type strain is 33 mol%.
Colonies after 2 days on P agar are circular, low-convex, smooth, glossy, opaque white, and 2–6 mm in diameter. Growth occurs aerobically and anaerobically in the presence of 0.0 to 7.5% NaCl. The type strain grows well in the presence of 10% NaCl, but growth is variable for other strains. No growth is observed in the presence of 15% NaCl. Growth occurs between 20 and 40°C: best growth occurs at 30°C. No growth is observed at 15 or 45°C.
This bacterium produces urease, alkaline phosphatase, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, beta-galactosidase, and beta-glucuronidase, and hydrolyses aesculin and Tween 80. It reduces nitrate to nitrite. It is negative for clumping factor, coagulase, hyaluronidase, arginine dihydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, acetoin, arginine arylamidase, alpha- and beta-haemolysins, heat-stable and heat-labile nucleases, indole, hydrogen sulphide, and lecithinase. It produces acid aerobically from D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, maltose, lactose, trehalose, mannitol, sucrose, L-arabinose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, glycerol, erythritol, D-xylose, arbutin, and salicin.
Acid is not formed aerobically from D-raffinose, ribose, D-cellobiose, D-arabinose, L-xylose, adonitol, methyl-D-xyloside, rhamnose, L-sorbose, dulcitol, starch, inositol, methyl-D-mannoside, methyl-D-glucoside, amygdalin, melibiose, melezitose, gentiobiose, glycogen, inulin, D-tagatose, D-lyxose, cellobiose, D-fucose, L-fucose, L-arabitol, gluconate, 2-ketogluconate or 5-ketogluconate.
Acid production from D-arabitol, sorbitol, turanose and xylitol is variable; the type strain is positive. It is resistant to novobiocin, bacitracin, vibriostatic agent O/129, lysozyme, metronidazole, and optochin. It is susceptible to lysostaphin, furazolidone, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, cephalexin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin sulphate, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, florfenicol, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, kanamycin, lincomycin, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, oxacillin, penicillin G, polymyxin B, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline, and vancomycin.
The quinone system consists of the major menaquinone MK-7 and minor amounts of MK-6 and MK-8. Predominant fatty acids are ai-C15:0, i-C15:0, and ai-C17:0, whilst i-C17:0, C18:0, C16:0, C20:0, and i-C19:0 are present in moderate amounts. Polar lipid profile consists of the major lipids diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unknown glycolipid.
This species has been isolated from dry-cured ham and from human urine, but its pathological significance is not yet clear.

If i can cook / you know god canif i can cook / you know god can (sometimes known as If I Can Cook You Know God Can) is a culinary memoir by Ntozake Shange. It was originally published by Beacon Press, in Boston MA, United States in 1998. The piece is both memoir and cookbook. Short essays precede recipes written in personal vernacular, and these recipes cover locations such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the United States.


== Synopsis ==


=== Chapter 1 ===
The book begins with a discussion of celebrations and the food that accompanies them, mentioning Frederick Douglass's lack of enthusiasm for the celebration of the Fourth of July, and asking why "would they want to celebrate the American Declaration of Liberation while the Fugitive Slave Act, which allowed the kidnapping of free slaves back to slave states on the word of any white man, was in effect?"  It details a winter during which Shange, determined to give her daughter a traditional Owens/Wilsons holiday, searches Clinton - Washington for ingredients. She looks for ways to recreate the traditional flavors, for she "tried to make again my very colored childhood and my very 'black' adolescence."  In this first chapter, Shange expresses feeling a connection to her ancestors through the re-creation of pig's feet, chitlins' Hoppin’ John, baked ham, collard greens and cornbread with syrup despite experiencing the holiday in a friends home and eating alone.


=== Chapter 2 ===
Chapter two takes the reader to St. Louis and Shange uses the experience of listening to a short wave radio emanating the sounds of Fidel Castro as a child to talk about her experiences in Cuba as an adult. She says that her child was one of Cuba's Young Pioneers and shared food, recipes and traditions with children from a multitude of other locations, such as Zimbabwe and Palestine. While in Cuba, the author experiences a blackface performance, which she is horrified by. She eats avocado with beer and reminds herself that "history, our history, mustn't scare me."  Cuba's slave trade history is discussed, and Shange is concerned with "How'd all these hardworking - cutting cane is torturous labor - Africans get fed and what'd they eat?" 


=== Chapter 3 ===
In chapter 3, Shange is in Nicaragua. She describes it as the "little country with the black people on one side of the mountain and the mestizoes and blancos on the other, while the Amerindians made a way for themselves in the jungles as best they could."  She shows the East and West coast as being uncommunicative and disconnected and the area she is familiar with being left with no infrastructure, which she describes as detrimental to the community. Shange's journey to the house of the esteemed poet Rubén Darío leads her to participate in a bus ride during the entire bus singing along to Usted Abuso, by Shange's favorite salsa singer. This makes her feel at home. Shange runs into Carlos Johnson and partakes in the experience of a dance hall. saying "we connect to the culture of the people we live with",


=== Chapter 4 ===
Shange is in Brixton, a working class West Indian neighborhood and she describes shopping in the area with her daughter, as they look for food items. Savannah and Shange prepare for her friend Leila's birthday dinner, and each of the ingredients used is described. At the end of the chapter, she mentions the fact that Leila's partner Darcus Howe is from Trinidad and Tobago, and makes a reference to the presence of slavery in East India. She ends with the quote: "Now we are independent. We own the soil. We have our own name. We have our own flag. Let us have some wine and some music." 


=== Chapter 5 ===
In chapter five, Shange is in the world of the Caribbean, and looking at the "matter of the flyin' fish"  in Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. Here, she describes the different ways in which two communities looked at one commodity. The Trinidad and Tobago fishermen were catching the flyin fish that were essential to the Barbadian diet, and didn’t eat it. While the Barbadians argued that it was wrong for them to catch the fish that they didn’t even eat and then sell it back as a profit, they said that they were only supplying the demand. She then says that who knows what would happen if the Barbadians came after shark meat, which is treasured by the Trinidadians.


=== Chapter 6 ===
Chapter six is about Brazil. Shange talks about the different colors of the populations of different sections of Brazil, saying that the south is industrialized and "mythologically white", while it's thought that the "Africans" live in the north. She talks about how when she was at a university in Bahia she asked each student to bring in the beginning of a performance piece or something based either off their lives or the world as they knew it. Each student talked about a myth, which she found disturbing and says that "My students were validating themselves as the 'other' where they were not the other."  Shange says that "We are not folklore."  In terms of Brazil, she says that "the epitome and apex of Brazilian life may be the continually multiplying mulatta, but we must all eat whatever our hue, or the hue and cry over who we are."  She then goes about looking at what makes up the primary dishes, focusing on Brazilian rice. Shange makes the point that Brazil has the highest percentage of people of African descent who live outside continent and that "We eat what they eat, just differently. These recipes have stayed with us for centuries, being improvised here and there, where we found somethin' we were accustomed to in, say, Guinea was not available at the mouth of the Amazon." 


=== Chapter 7 ===
In Chapter 7, Shange talks about the Juba, "a dance of coutrin'", that is found in the Caribbean and the community of slaves in North America. Chapter 7 briefly discusses dance in slave culture and says that "it's time to tend to our own gardens. Let's grow some sweet potatoes to keep the niggah alive."  It mentions the crops that were carried into the new world, and talks about Carolina rice, which Shange was raised on. It talks about different preparations of rice, and Shange relates style of cooking to location. She chides her mother for thinking that spice and a burnt bottom are ruining the rice, when rice with a crusty bottom is common in the Caribbean. Shange then goes back to dance, talking about classes taken at the Clark Center.


=== Chapter 8 ===
Chapter eight talks about the assimilation of people to western territories and how old dishes are adapted to new locations, as well as the lack of knowledge newly arrived slaves had about the treatment of Native Americans. It talks about the ramifications of the Dred Scott decision. Oklahoma is mentioned as "our nearest place of safety", and A. G. Belton is mentioned as an entrepreneur who wrote to the American Colonization Society about the problems of post slavery communities. She questions the Buffalo Soldiers' treatment of the Native Americans and the way that "we changed, made necessary readjustments to our gods and belief systems to accommodate the Christianity thrust upon us as our salvation." (p. 54). She also discusses debate around bones of freemen that were found along Vine Street Expressway in Philadelphia. She says that bones have to be moved to make room for other things and that it was acceptable for the removed bones to be moved because they belonged to what were considered a "lower species of man". This leads to a part about the treatment of deceased African - Americans and what happens to their remains. Shange says that the world of slavery and the European took "what the world was to us out of our control?" 


=== Chapter 9 ===
Chapter 9 looks at African Americans in Texas. She says that slaves in Texas weren't immediately informed that they were free until General Order number three was issued. African American Texans created their own independence day (Juneteenth) and she asserts that they found ways of finding community. She describes arenas commanded by African American cowboys who were continuing tradition, as well as her own participation. She says that rodeos were another venue for food, with women producing barbecue; she provides a recipe for Texan beef barbecue. She tells a story about convincing her father to come see her race barrels in Hitchcock, Texas, and about the barbecue they had. She details her father's reaction the barbecue and sauce, and his comparison of it to his own barbecue. Shange makes mention of the fact that "I was raised to experiment with taste and sound, thus my interest in music, language, and food, but more importantly to never turn my nose or chin up to any kinda food that anybody ate." 


=== Chapter 10 ===
Chapter ten begins with a mention of Elijah Muhammad's column "How to Eat to Live". Shange talks about Frank Yerby's play Foxes of Harrow and looks at his characters "defiant and self - determining"  and at Yerby as someone who actively rejected Southern antebellum life, without denying its existence. From there, Shange looks at refusing food as "one of many methods Africans used to maintain some dignity, some control of their lives". She discusses the relationship between crackheads, dope fiends and slavery and writes that "Cooking is a way of insisting on living,"  and saying that "When we are hungry for life, we search out spice, aromas, and texture to entice and please those around us."  She uses gumbo as an example here and references the cities of Charleston and New Orleans. She discusses different ways to make roux and then the way to add okra to gumbo, yet says that her own immediate family does not like okra.


=== Chapter 11 ===
Chapter eleven looks at boys. Shange says that from the first, she was expected to serve boys food, and that this was part of a dating ritual "to prove I was of value, valued my visitors and our time together so much that I made a hands-on effort to create something for whoever this person was". She discusses her adolescent reaction to it and her later realization that was being taught an important "Southern/African tradition of sharing the best I had with visitors". (p. 80). She describes the link between cooking and self value, as well as the energy and importance of time in the kitchen. She mentions that music can assist the kitchen process.


=== Chapter 12 ===
Chapter twelve looks at the need "to re-create a 'where' for our people". It looks at people who do not commit to the American way of life. Shange talks about meeting a Rastafarian in Cancun, Mexico, and the ways in which African culture was destabilized during slavery. She uses the limitation of diet as an example. Yvette, a friend, is used as an example; she explains that her vegetarianism is an alternative choice to the meat and dairy diet suggested by America. In this chapter, Shange looks at the idea that African Americans are a "people in transition"  describes the first bembe she ever attended and talks about African American Jews.


=== Epilogue ===
The epilogue contains references to Shange's dance experience and talks about sugar, giving people something to make them happy, and providing dessert recipes.


== Analysis ==
The author herself once described this difficult to define project as one of "writing some thoughts about food", It allows the author to see herself both within the tradition she is exploring as an individual, and is a tribute to black cuisine as a food that reflects the spirit and history of a people. Shange actually moved her bedroom into the kitchen while writing the book  She looks at food as something that celebrates the history, migration and soul of a people. Here, food provides the backdrop and basis for questions of identity that involve origin, relocation and what ultimately has the power to bring people together. The essays before each recipe endow them with historical, emotional, and communal importance. The small essays allow her to "understand or recognize herself in the history and culture of other African - origin people of the world... travels to Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or places undeniably products of the African Diaspora launch Shange's thoughts on being and identity."  Shange puts extreme value on food, evident in an interview with The Sun, in which she says that "I believe you should eat and prepare food with the same care you treat a newborn infant",
if i can cook / you know god can explores history, and the ways in which food and culture are intertwined. Different people, cultures and locations come together in the food put on the table, and the recipes that the food comes from. By writing about the food culture she comes from, Shange asserts the importance of the food she details and provides recipes for, the food that is important to her people. She claims this food culture, and history, as important, worthy of recognition, remembrance, and immortality in writing. Shange refuses to let this history be ignored. As said by Mosaic Literary Magazine, "This is not a cookbook, it's a food lesson, a means by which the African diasporic existence is ultimately justified."  Shange sees connection between food and history, and has said that "I also wanted to write about {blacks'} relationship to food as a people in bondage and how that changed."  In this work, Shange actively addresses the past, and "goes well beyond mere listings of ingredients to show how various foods reflect the black experience from the slave ships to the present". For example, Shange introduces the readers to "Afro-Atlantic foodways"  which is a type of food that came to being on slave ships.
This piece discusses the importance of location in relation to food. Eating brings people together. Shange displays the ways in which recipes are adapted according to location. When people move, they bring a food history with them, and yet it evolves according to the availability of ingredients, culture, traditions and influence of present location. Therefore, recipes are spread to different locations, evolving and yet simultaneously staying true to tradition. In a review in The Booklist by Alice Joynce, she says that Shange "paints a fervent, richly impassioned chronicle of African American experience, at the same time making note of political situations and discord among the peoples of these nations and recording how connections are made beyond issues of class or skin color. Recipes serve as savory, nourishing garnishes" Shange displays the ways in which certain recipes and traditions have survived over time, allowing people to remember and recall Africa, even when in a different place. Food is a way for "black folks in the Western Hemisphere to be full". For example, Shange "identifies the African American migration west after the Civil War and how the voyage was fueled by the hunting and farming skills folks learned during slavery. She makes these connections from a fundamental love for and admiration of the development of African contributions to the new world order". Shange claims that by continuing, but adapting, past food culture to location, African Americans declare the presence and importance of their culture in a new location, such as the United States. She is asking the questions "Where did black folks end up? How did they cope with relocation?" and realizing that the answer is "at the table, where hearts, minds, and bellies come together and are made full".
Shange looks at food as a feature of memory as well, for not only is the memory of history bestowed upon food but food, as a product of a long and rich culture, can trigger memory. When Shange spends New Years with her daughter in New York, she has an "insatiable desire to recreate for her daughter the family holidays she remembered".
This wor2013 Vuelta a EspañaThe 2013 Vuelta a España was the 68th edition of the race.
This Vuelta started in Galicia on August 24, 2013. The race spent 5 days in Galicia, then continued anticlockwise touring Spain through Castile and León, Extremadura, Andalusia, Aragon, Catalonia, La Rioja, Cantabria, and Asturias, before returning to Madrid for the finish on September 15. The Vuelta included excursions into two neighboring countries, Andorra and France. The top three stage winners received the following bonuses in the general classification: 10 seconds for winners of the stages, six seconds for runners-up, and four seconds for those in third place.
Chris Horner won the 2013 Vuelta at the age of 41 on the 15 September 2013 becoming the oldest ever Grand Tour winner. Horner beat his nearest challenger, Italian Vincenzo Nibali by finishing ahead of him in each of the final three mountainous stages before the final stage into Madrid.

== Stages ==


== Race overview ==
For details see 2013 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2013 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21


== Classification leadership table ==
There were four main classifications contested in the 2013 Vuelta a España, with the most important being the general classification. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the red jersey; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the Vuelta. In 2013, there were time bonuses given on mass-start stages; ten seconds were awarded to the stage winner, with six for second and four for third.
Additionally, there was a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and is identified with a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. The organisation categorised some climbs as either hors catégorie, first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a blue polka dot jersey.
The fourth individual classification was the combination classification, marked by the white jersey. This classification is calculated by adding the numeral ranks of each cyclist in the general, points and mountains classifications – a rider must have a score in all classifications possible to qualify for the combination classification – with the lowest cumulative total signifying the winner of this competition.
For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. For the combativity award, a jury gives points after each stage to the cyclists they considered most combative. The cyclist with the most votes in all stages leads the classification. For the daily combative winner, the rider in question donned a dossard with a red background, on the following stage.

== History ==
The college was opened in 1959 to meet the needs of the local coal mining industry. Since the 1970s the curriculum diversified to assist the diversification and development of the locality. The College worked closely with Caerphilly County Borough Council to improve the economic future of the County Borough.


== Building Work ==
The College Ystrad Mynach underwent extensive building work to areas of its campus in recent years making it one of the most modern and hi-tech campuses in Wales.
2001 - A Block

Housing the main reception, administration offices and some teaching areas, A Block had a complete refurbishment in 2001. The refurbishment costing £2.5 million transformed the block from its previous dated state which was first built in 1959 into one of the most modern campus buildings in Wales.
2002 - Cafe Quarter Officially opened by former Caerphilly AM Ron Davies, a new Cafe Quarter was completed in 2002 providing students with improved modern catering facilities.
2003 - S Block Graddfa Site
Following the merging of Lewis School sites into one location at Pengam, The College purchased a site previously used by Lewis School that was located adjacent to The College Ystrad Mynach (previously Graddfa Secondary Modern School). With student enrolments for The College Ystrad Mynach increasing in the years before 2003, the Graddfa site provided much needed additional space. Following months of extensive renovations to bring the site to an acceptable standard, the site was used as a teaching area from August 2003, housing GCSE, A Level, Education and Training, Languages and Art Provision. The College Ystrad Mynach acquired a grant during the renovation work to build additional changing rooms. These changing rooms serve not only The College but the numerous sports teams that use Ystrad Mynach park for activities on Saturday’s and Sunday’s.
2004 - D Block

A 3 storey state of the art Technology Building titled ‘D Block’ was completed in January 2004 at a cost of £2 million replacing a previous 2 storey building that had been standing since 1959. Officially opened by Roger Jones OBE, Chairman Welsh Development Agency, the building transformed The College’s engineering provision to the highest standards. The block currently serves Construction, Electronics, Aerospace, Electrical and Design courses.
2009-2010 - B Block

Building work commenced in June 2009 on a new B Block facility costing £7.2M which houses 13 classrooms, a new library, improved catering facilities and public areas for learners, exhibitions, competitions and public events. College Principal Bryn Davies commented “B Block will provide the college with much needed space for the 13,000 learners that walk through its door each year. ‘Since 2000, the college has grown extensively in both student numbers and provision. The new facility will allow us provide our learners with leading edge teaching facilities and much needed social areas for our learners.’ Said Bryn Davies, Principal of the college.

== Campuses ==

The main campus is in Ystrad MJeremaine CopelandJeremaine Copeland (born February 19, 1977) is a former professional gridiron football wide receiver who is currently the wide receivers coach for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League. He has played with the Montreal Alouettes, Calgary Stampeders, and Toronto Argonauts, as well as in the XFL and NFL Europe.


== College career ==
Copeland attended the University of Tennessee. While there, he posted 131 receptions for 1,300 yards (9.92 yards per rec. avg.). At Tennessee, he played with Peyton Manning and Jamal Lewis while wearing number six for the Vols.


== NFL Europe career ==
Copeland played a year of NFL Europe football for the Barcelona Dragons. He ended the season with a team leading 74 receptions for 821 yards (11.1 yards per rec. avg.) and six touchdowns.


== CFL, NFL, & XFL career ==
Copeland began his CFL career with the Montreal Alouettes in 2001 and played six games. During that season he also starred at WR with the XFL's champion Los Angeles Xtreme. He was known for his flashy big plays and the famous long skull cap tail hanging out of his helmet during his time with the XFL. After beginning the 2002 season in the Dallas Cowboys' training camp, Copeland returned to the Alouettes and contributed to their Grey Cup championship that year. Copeland picked up CFL and CFLPA all-star honours in 2003 after piling up 99 receptions and 1757 receiving yards. Along with teammate Ben Cahoon, Copeland set a CFL record for most receiving yards by two teammates, amassing 3,318 yards between them. In 2004, Copeland was one of four receivers with the Alouettes to eclipse the 1000-yard receiving mark (the others were Cahoon, Thyron Anderson, and Kwame Cavil), a CFL record which was repeated by the Alouettes the following year.
In 2005, Copeland was lured west to join the Calgary Stampeders after he entered free agency. Although his statistics did not reach the same levels as those achieved with the Alouettes, Copeland and Stampeder teammate Nik Lewis became infamous for their elaborate touchdown celebrations, including a "human bicycle" during the 2005 season, and the "bobsled" at the endzone pylon during the 2006 season. On November 23, 2008, Copeland and teammates of the Calgary Stampeders won the Grey Cup against the hosting Montreal Alouettes, 22-14. In 2009, Copeland enjoyed his best season since 2003 when he recorded 1,235 receiving yards and led the league with 12 receiving touchdowns, earning CFL all-star honours that year.
On February 17, 2010 Copeland was traded to the Toronto Argonauts in exchange for wide receiver P. K. Sam. He was elected as the team's offensive captain, leading an inexperienced receiving corps and being a crutch for inexperienced CFL quarterback Cleo Lemon. With the team, he was reunited with former XFL teammate Noel Prefontaine. On November 3, 2011, he surpassed the 10,000 career receiving yard mark, becoming the 15th CFL player to do so.
On January 25, 2012, Copeland officially retired from the CFL after 11 seasons in professional football.


== Coaching career ==
After announcing his retirement, Copeland was named the wide receivers coach of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, joining former offensive coordinator George Cortez who was now the team's head coach. Following the 2012 season, Copeland left the Tiger-Cats to complete his degree at the University of Tennessee.
On February 20, 2015, the Saskatchewan Roughriders announced that Copeland would be joining the team as their new receivers coach.

BataireachtIn Irish martial arts, bataireacht ([ˈbˠat̪ˠəɾʲaxt̪ˠ], meaning stick-fighting) or boiscín is the various forms of stick-fighting from Ireland.


== Definition ==
Bataireacht is a category of stick-fighting martial arts of Ireland.
Bata is the Irish term for any kind of stick. In stickfighting, the actual bata or stick used for bataireacht is a Sail Éille (anglicised as shillelagh) or, in earlier texts, a cudgel. Blackthorn, oak, ash and hazel were traditionally the most common types of woods used to make shillelagh fighting sticks. Some authors have argued that prior to the 19th Century, the term had been used to refer to a form of stick-fencing used to train Irish soldiers in broadsword and sabre techniques. Upon further observations it appears that the art might have been developed by the working class more or less independently as no technical source seem to hint at a sword fencing origin.
The style is mostly characterized by the use of a cudgel, a knobbed stick, of different lengths but most often the size of a walking stick or small club. The stick is grabbed by the third, the lower part protecting the elbow and allowing the user to maintain an offensive as well as defensive guard. This unusual grip also allows to launch fast punching like strikes.


== History ==
The Irish have used various sticks and cudgels as weapons of self-defence for centuries. As with most vernacular martial arts, it is difficult to establish the origin of the art. Weapons similar to shillelagh are described in various sources including heroic tales such as The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel. It would truly begin to catch the attention of writers in the 18th century. The shillelagh is still identified with Irish popular culture to this day, although the arts of bataireacht are much less so. The sticks used for bataireacht are not of a standardised size, as there are various styles of bataireacht, using various kinds of sticks.
By the 18th century bataireacht became increasingly associated with Irish gangs called "factions". Irish faction fights involved large groups of men (and sometimes women) who engaged in melees at county fairs, weddings, funerals, or any other convenient gathering. Historians such as Carolyn Conley, believe that this reflected a culture of recreational violence. It is also argued that faction fighting had class and political overtones, as depicted for example in the works of William Carleton and James S. Donnelly, Jr.'s "Irish Peasants: Violence & Political Unrest, 1780".
By the early 19th century, these gangs had organised into larger regional federations, which coalesced from the old Whiteboys, into the Caravat and Shanavest factions. Beginning in Munster the Caravat and Shanavest "war" erupted sporadically throughout the 19th century and caused some serious disturbances.
As the faction fights became increasingly repressed and other sports such as hurling were promoted, bataireacht slowly faded away by the turn of the 20th century. Although still documented sporadically, it has become mostly an underground practice saved by a few families who still handed down their own styles.


== Modern practice ==
The modern practice of bataireacht has arisen amongst some practitioners from a desire to maintain or reinstate Irish family traditions, while for others a combination of historical and cultural interest has led to their interest. Bataireacht has also gained popularity amongst non-Irish people, especially in North-America, as a form of self-defence, especially as a cane or walking stick can be easily carried in modern society.
A few forms of bataireacht survive to this day, some of which are traditional styles specific to the family which carried them down through the years, like the rince an bhata uisce bheatha ('dance [of] the whiskey stick') style of the Doyle family of Newfoundland, taught in Canada, the United-States and Germany, or the Antrim stick which is taught in Canada, the United States, Ireland, Mexico and France.
Additionally, members of the Western martial arts movement have "reconsBlue Wing BlitzBlue Wing Blitz (ブルーウィングブリッツ) is a Japanese-exclusive tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square on July 5, 2001 for the WonderSwan Color and compatible with the WonderSwan.
Unlike standard tactical video games, Blue Wing Blitz focuses on aerial battles, fought with aircraft, which can be customized. The events of the game begins in the Esk Republic, in an unnamed fictional world. Esk is threatened by the militaristic empire of Ordia, and the player's party is given the mission to repel the invasion.


== Gameplay ==

Blue Wing Blitz is a traditional turn-based tactical role-playing game, although it has the particularity of involving mostly aerial warfare units. These are moved on a grid map, and an encounter with an enemy unit opens a separate, close-up combat screen in which up to two ally units and two enemy units engage in a short dogfight; the player using menu commands to attack, change altitude or take evasive maneuvers.
Different parts of each unit can be damaged, and the success of each attack depends on the units' stats as well as maneuvers. Several ground units are also present on the grid map, and can only be destroyed by bombers. The level of fuel and amount of ammunition of each unit are limited and must be replenished when necessary.
After each mission, aircraft can be upgraded, customized or remodeled with various weapons and equipment developed in factory. Which upgrades are available depends on the player's degree of success in the precedent mission.


== Plot ==


=== Setting ===
The fictional world of Blue Wing Blitz is composed of floating islands, and usage of aircraft is widespread. Most of the islands are owned and ruled by the expansionist Ordia Empire, which possess superior aircraft. One of the independent states is the Esk Republic, a rich agrarian nation which supplies food to other countries, such as the United Federation of Roggina or the Kingdoms of Mackai and Peag. At the beginning of the game, Trund, the Prime Minister of Esk, assembles a rebel force to reclaim territories menaced by Ordia.


=== Characters ===

The players controls the members of Esk's rebel force, who each have a distinct aircraft. The main character of the game is a sixteen-year-old pilot trainee named Keid, from Tadaga Village, while the second playable character is Payer, a female senior pilot of the same age. She volunteers to defend Tadaga from enemy armies and meets Keid, who becomes enlisted in the rebel force as an officer. The third playable character, Havilan, is a veteran piloting a flying gunboat.
Other playable characters include notably Blore, a strategist and devoted pilot of the royal air force of Mackai; and Rayetta, his younger sister and bomber pilot. Roster, an ally of Ordia who secretly leads the Roggina Spirit resistance also joins the player's party; as does Poty, the fourth prince of Peag and bomber pilot, and his female guard Sersh.


== Development ==
Blue Wing Blitz was officially announced on March 8, 2001, and was Square's second original title for Bandai's Japan-exclusive handheld console WonderSwan Color, after Wild Card. A trailer of the game was featured in the bonus DVD included in the Japanese release of Final Fantasy X.
The game was developed by the same team responsible for the Front Mission series, while the characters were designed by Nobuyuki Ikeda. The score for the game, which was never released in album form, was composed by Kumi Tanioka and was the first time that she composed a soundtrack entirely by herself.
A 95-page official strategy guide, titled Blue Wing Blitz Freedom Fighter's Guide, was published by DigiCube on the same date as the game. The contents include information on the characters and the setting, battle system explanations, map screenshots, and reference and data tables.


== Reception ==
Blue Wing Blitz sold poorly, with around 20,000 units sold one year after its release. In a preview of the title, the gaming website GIA praised the graphics of the game, stating that Nobuyuki Ikeda's character designs "add style and charm" to the battles and cutscenes despite simple field graphics and the console's technical limitations. RPGamer noted that the game's focus on aircraft was an "interesting new take on a classic concept". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish used Blue Wing Blitz as an example of one of the WonderSwan's major games.

Kiev TV TowerThe Kiev TV Tower (Ukrainian: Телевізійна вежа, Televiziyna vezha) is a 385 m-high (1,263 ft) lattice steel tower built in 1973 in Kiev, Ukraine, for radio and television broadcasting. It is the tallest freestanding lattice steel construction in the world. The tower in Oranzhereina Street is not open to the public.
Construction began in 1968 and finished in 1973 at a cost of approximately $12 million. Made of steel pipe of various diameters and thicknesses, the structure weighs 2,700 tonnes. The central pipe, or core, where the elevator is located, is 4 metres in diameter and made of pipe that is 12 mm thick. It sits on a four-legged base that is about 100 metres tall. Atop the base is an enclosed level which houses microwave transmitting and receiving equipment. At about 200 metres is a second enclosed level that houses television and FM transmitters, as well as a control and maintenance shop. This second level is the elevator's terminus.
The tower is unique in that no mechanical fasteners such as rivets are used in the structure: every joint, pipe and fixture is attached by welding.
The tower was first designed for Moscow, then the Soviet capital. But Moscow authorities preferred a more "solid" type of tower which was eventually built (Ostankino Tower). Later, when Kiev needed its own tower, the project was reintroduced. The Soviet government ordered the engineers to shorten the tower by almost 30%, so as not to be as tall as the Moscow one.

Lady Day: The Complete Billie Holiday on Columbia 1933–1944Lady Day: The Complete Billie Holiday on Columbia 1933–1944 is a box set ten-disc compilation of the complete known studio master recordings, plus alternate takes, of Billie Holiday during the time period indicated, released in 2001 on Columbia/Legacy, CXK 85470. Designed like an album of 78s, the medium in which these recordings initially appeared, the 10.5" × 12" box includes 230 tracks, a 116 page booklet with extensive photos, a song list, discography, essays by Michael Brooks, Gary Giddins, and Farah Jasmine Griffin, and an insert of appreciations for Holiday from a diversity of figures including Tony Bennett, Elvis Costello, Marianne Faithfull, B.B. King, Abbey Lincoln, Jill Scott, and Lucinda Williams. At the 44th Grammy Awards on February 27, 2002, the box set won the Grammy Award for Best Historical Album of the previous year.


== History ==
These recordings were made in a time before the LP album, introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. Starting at approximately the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, recorded music arrived on the market in the form of a ten-inch gramophone record that played at 78 revolutions per minute, two songs of generally no more than four minutes duration per side. The advent of radio increased demand for recorded music played in the home through the 1920s. However, during the Great Depression, home record sales decreased dramatically, but a relatively viable market still existed for the inexpensive play of records in jukeboxes, which had proliferated during the 1920s and 1930s. Initially, these records featuring Billie Holiday were made with that market in mind.
John Hammond, who had discovered Holiday singing in a Harlem jazz club in 1933, arranged for her first recording session that same year on November 27. In the company of Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa, and Hammond's future brother-in-law Benny Goodman, the two sides with Holiday would be released under Goodman's name. A little over nineteen months later, Holiday would be in another New York studio for her second session in association with Goodman again, as well as Ben Webster and Cozy Cole, under the leadership of Teddy Wilson. From July 2, 1935, through August 7, 1941, Holiday would regularly record, for commercial issue, 78s credited to herself or to Wilson.
With a few exceptions, these records were originally released on labels other than Columbia which catered to an African American market, then referred to as race records. The labels Brunswick Records and Vocalion Records became fellow companies to Columbia when it was purchased in 1934 by the American Record Corporation, which had owned Brunswick and Vocalion since late 1931. Records credited to Wilson were released on Brunswick; those to Holiday on Vocalion. With the purchase of ARC in 1939 by CBS, the corporation re-organized its record labels under the aegis of Columbia as the parent company. Starting in 1940, the Holiday releases were issued on the Okeh Records imprint, reactivated by CBS to handle its product for the "race record" market.


== Content ==
Discs one through six, and disc seven tracks one through fourteen present the master takes in chronological recorded order. The remainder of disc seven, and discs eight through ten, present the alternate takes and other items, also in chronological recorded order. The other items consist of eight tracks not part of the general body of Wilson/Holiday recordings from 1935 to 1941. The first, track 15 of disc seven "Saddest Tale" with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, was taken from the soundtrack to the movie short Symphony in Black by Paramount Pictures in 1935. Disc eight, tracks three through five, contain airchecks with the Count Basie Orchestra from 1937, the only documentation of Holiday's year-long tenure as Basie's band singer. Disc nine, tracks seven and eight, feature recordings broadcast on the Camel Caravan radio variety program of January 17, 1939; with backing by the Benny Goodman Orchestra, Billie sings alongside Johnny Mercer, Martha Tilton, and Leo Watson on the second song, Mercer's "Jeepers Creepers".
The final two tracks of the set, numbers 22 and 23 of disc ten, are from the Esquire Award Winners Concert at the Metropolitan Opera, broadcast and recorded on V-Discs for distribution to servicemen fighting overseas during World War II. Holiday had won top female jazz vocalist for 1943, and became the first African-American woman to sing at the Met. "Do Nothing 'Til You Hear From Me" and "Billie's Blues," under a different title, are performed accompanied by other Esquire poll winners, Roy Eldridge, Barney Bigard, Art Tatum, Al Casey, Oscar Pettiford, and Sidney Catlett. This recording took place more than two years after the final studio session in 1941, and during the Petrillo recording ban; the AFM waived the strike terms for the recording of V-discs.
Original recording sessions took place at the following locations in New York City: at the 55 Fifth Avenue Studio on November 27, 1933; at the 1776 Broadway Studio from 1935 through January 1939; at the 711 Fifth Avenue Studio from March 1939 through June 1940; at Liederkranz Hall on East 58th Street in September and October 1940; and at Columbia Studios in their new headquarters at 799 Seventh Avenue in 1941. Known producers for the original recordings are John Hammond and Bernie Hanighen.


== Significance ==
In terms of a collected body of work combining both influence and quality of achievement, these recordings are some of the most important in jazz history. Ranking jazz records always presents an exercise in both controversy and consternation, but certainly the Wilson/Holiday sides belong in the company of the Hot Five and Hot Sevens of Louis Armstrong, the collated set by Fletcher Henderson later called A Study In Frustration, the early Basie band on Decca, Duke Ellington's records with Ben Webster and Jimmy Blanton for RCA Victor, the Charlie Parker bebop sides for Savoy and Dial, and the Atlantic LPs by Ornette Coleman, not to mention the expanse of albums by Miles Davis and John Coltrane, together and separately.
The sessions coincide with the rise of the swing era on its way to becoming the popular music of the United States during the late Depression and war years. Chosen by Hammond, Hanighen, Holiday, or Wilson, many of the musicians present derived from the top swing bands of the day, such as those by Ellington, Basie, Goodman, Artie Shaw, Jimmie Lunceford, and Cab Calloway, among others. Of special note are the records cut with members of the Basie band, Holiday herself hired by Basie in 1937, including his fabulous rhythm section of Freddie Green, Walter Page, and Jo Jones, along with key soloists Buck Clayton and Holiday's musical soul-mate, Lester Young. The roster of Holiday and Wilson sidemen reads like a who's who of jazz soloists from the 1930s, many of whom would be of great influence to later styles of bebop, cool jazz, third stream, virtually every aspect of jazz through the 1960s.
Like Armstrong's Hot Five aggregations and The Beatles after 1966, the various bands assembled were purely creatures of the studio, although some sessions featured principally members of Basie's touring band, accustomed to playing together regularly on the road. The sessions acted as a workshop, allowing musicians who usually did not intermix professionally outside of cutting contests to exchange ideas. As has been remarked upon by numerous critics and jazz scholars, the special appeal of Holiday in this setting derived from her fitting in with the other musicians as a musician, taking her solo with the rest of them. General practice of the day dictated that the song be paramount, musicians subservient to the band arrangement or the singing star. Producers Hammond and Hanighen, both aligned more to the artistic than the business of end of jazz, encouraged the musicians rather to play as they wished. The results over six years offered a textbook in swing jazz played by small groups in a relaxed yet committed fashion.
As a singer, Holiday had influence on defining the style of a big band vocalist after that of Bing Crosby and her role model, Louis Armstrong. Her records appeared just as the swing era was getting underway; subsequently, singers such as Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Anita O'Day, Peggy Lee, and Doris Day, for instance, starting out with the bands of Chick Webb, Tommy Dorsey, Gene Krupa, Benny Goodman, and Les Brown, all found inspiration in the Holiday records on Brunswick and Vocalion. Her manipulation of rhythm and length of musical phrases, allied to her ability to find emotional resonance in songs, was acknowledged publicly as a template by singers from her own era, Sinatra, Lee, Bennett, and others, and by myriad singers in later eras. As stated by Gary Giddins in the liner notes to the box set:
"When I first got to know ["A Sailboat in the Moonlight"], I thought it a fine melody with pretty chord changes and words that might be corny but didn't seem to be so bad when Lady Day delivered them. Then I chanced to find the sheet music at a Midwestern bazaar; at home, I picked out the melody with one finger and was astonished at how different it was from what Holiday sang. Until that moment, I had not fully gauged how freely imaginative her embellishments could be. By ironing out a phrase here, retarding another there, raising this note, slurring that, she transformed a hopelessly banal and predictable melody into something personal, real, meaningful."
That Sony would lavish such an expensive box for recordings originally designed for the inexpensive medium of jukebox play from six to seven decades previously stands as testament to the staying power of this body of work.

Lost for Words (2013 film)Lost for Words is a 2013 romantic drama starring Sean Faris, Grace Huang, Will Yun Lee, and Terence Yin. It was theatrically released in North America on October 18, 2013. The film's tagline is "Do you Find Love….or does Love Find You?"


== Plot ==
Amid the sweeping cityscape of cosmopolitan Hong Kong, ANNA ZHOU (Grace Huang), a dancer from Beijing meets MICHAEL VANCE (Sean Faris), a decorated ex-Marine now IT specialist.
Hailing from the prestigious Beijing Dance Academy, Anna is determined to make her mark in the world of modern ballet. Unlike her best friend and fellow dancer MEI MEI (Joman Chiang), Anna is cautious with relationships and has taken a vow of chastity.
After a rocky start, Michael befriends co-worker STANFORD LAU (Will Yun Lee), another computer specialist. With Stanford’s assistance, Michael navigates the competitive business world by applying his skills as a warrior. At the same time, Michael hopes the new city and his demanding work schedule will ease the pain of a recent break-up.
Michael and Anna’s paths cross and a platonic friendship is struck. Michael assists Anna with her English while she teaches him Chinese. Through these language lessons and their Hong Kong adventures, Michael, without realizing it, finds a new lease on life. Slowly the wall around his heart begins to crack.
Meanwhile, the premiere of Anna’s pivotal solo performance nears. Anna begins to doubt her abilities and seeks solace from her mentor, the dashing Ballet Master VICTOR YOUNG (Terence Yin).
On the day, Anna’s dance solo overwhelms Michael’s unrecognized resistance to the love she offers. Love blossoms.
At Michael’s insistence, the couple journey to Anna’s village home in Mainland China during Chinese New Year, an important time for all wayward travelers to re-unite with their families.
This fateful journey breaks the lovers apart. Will love survive?


== Production ==
Filming started on January 2, 2012 in Hong Kong in a small French café called Chez Patrick. This is where Anna and Michael first meet after they agree to help each other with language lessons. Over the course of 40 shooting days, the cast and crew traversed from one end of Hong Kong to the other. From the cosmopolitan financial center to rural landscapes to the outlying islands. One of the most spectacular scenes was shot at the famed Ngong Ping 360 on Lantau Island. Other locations included Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park, Lai Chi Kok Park, and the iconic Star Ferry.
The film features the hip hop song "Hong Kong Kowloon" by Hong Kong hip hop group 24HERBS.
Post Production took place at Park Road Post in Wellington, New Zealand.

 num of2016 Tour of FlandersThe 2016 Tour of Flanders was a one-day classic cycling race that took place in Belgium on Sunday 3 April 2016. It was the 100th edition of the Tour of Flanders; it was the eighth event of the UCI World Tour and the third of the cobbled one-day classics. It was the second Monument race of the 2016 cycling season.
The race started in Bruges and finished in Oudenaarde. The total distance was 255 kilometres (158 mi), covering 18 categorized climbs and seven flat cobblestoned sectors. The principal favourites for the overall victory were Fabian Cancellara (Trek–Segafredo), Tom Boonen (Etixx–Quick-Step) and Peter Sagan (Tinkoff).
After several riders had abandoned the race due to crashes and injuries, the decisive break was formed with 30 kilometres (19 mi) to go by Sagan, Michał Kwiatkowski (Team Sky) and Sep Vanmarcke (LottoNL–Jumbo). On the last climb of the Oude Kwaremont, Kwiatkowski was dropped; on the Paterberg, which followed shortly afterwards and was final climb of the race, Sagan dropped Vanmarcke and set off alone towards the finish. Vanmarcke and Cancellara collaborated in an effort to chase him down, but Sagan was able to ride to the finish alone. Cancellara finished second with Vanmarcke third, both more than 20 seconds behind Sagan.


== Route ==

The route of the 100th edition was presented on 29 November 2015 at Brussels Airport. It contained small changes from previous editions: the Tiegemberg in West Flanders was omitted, while in the Flemish Ardennes the flat cobbled sector of the Holleweg was cut from the race and replaced with the Jagerij cobbled road. The change was needed to keep the iconic Molenberg climb in the route due to roadworks. The recent tradition of announcing a Dorp van de Ronde ("Village of the Tour") was also abandoned, although the route passed through Kanegem and Aarsele in tribute to Briek Schotte and Roger Decock (the oldest living winner of the Tour of Flanders) respectively.
The race started in the Market Square in Bruges with a neutralised zone, leaving the town to the south. The racing started outside the city and took the riders southwest through Torhout to Roeselare, then east through Ardooie and Tielt, then south-east to Oudenaarde, passing across the first cobbled sector of the day, the flat Huisepontweg. After Oudenaarde, the route continued into a series of circuits through the hilly area to the south and east. After 103 kilometres (64 mi) came the first climb, the Oude Kwaremont, a 2,200-metre (2,400 yd), partially cobbled climb that would feature twice more later in the race. The route turned north and, following the climb of the non-cobbled Kortekeer, the riders entered a 20-kilometre (12 mi) section with several cobbled roads. These included the cobbled climbs of the Eikenberg and the Wolvenberg, then the flat Ruiterstraat, Kerkgate and Jagerij, the climb of the Molenberg, then finally the 2,300 metres (2,500 yd) of the flat Paddestraat. The route then turned back to the south-west, across the flat Haaghoek cobbles and then the non-cobbled climbs of the Leberg, Berendries, Valkenberg, Kaperij and Kanarieberg. This brought the route back to take on the second ascent of the Oude Kwaremont, followed immediately by the steep cobbled climb of the Paterberg, 360 metres (390 yd) long with an average gradient of 12.9% and sections at over 20%. At the summit of the Paterberg, there were 51 kilometres (32 mi) left to the finish.
There were six more climbs in the next 40-kilometre (25 mi) loop. The first of these was the Koppenberg, which includes the steepest roads of the race, with gradients of 22%. This was followed by the flat cobbles of the Mariaborrestraat and the climbs of the Steenbeekdries and the Taaienberg. The roads took the riders south into Ronse for the climb of the Kruisberg, then north-west to the foot of the Oude Kwaremont. The Oude Kwaremont–Paterberg combination was used for a second time; at the top of the Paterberg there were 11.7 kilometres (7.3 mi) to the finish. These took place over mainly flat roads, with a long finishing straight on the outskirts of Oudenaarde.


=== Climbs and cobbled roads ===
In total, the race included eighteen categorized climbs.
Additionally, there were seven sectors of flat cobbled roads:


== Participating teams ==
The 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to participate in the race. An additional seven UCI Professional Continental teams were given wildcard entries: two Belgian teams (Wanty–Groupe Gobert and Topsport Vlaanderen–Baloise), a Dutch team (Roompot–Oranje Peloton), a German team (Bora–Argon 18), a French team (Direct Énergie), an Italian team (Wilier Triestina–Southeast) and a Polish team (CCC–Sprandi–Polkowice). With eight on each team, the peloton at the start of the race included 200 riders. Of these, 118 reached the finish line.


== Pre-race favourites ==
The principal favourites for the race were Tom Boonen (Etixx–Quick-Step) and Fabian Cancellara (Etixx–Quick-Step), both of whom had won the race on three previous occasions. Cancellara was in strong form, having won the Strade Bianche and having come fourth in E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem the previous week. Boonen, however, was not in strong form: he had not won a major classic since 2012 and had not performed strongly in the previous week's races. Nevertheless, Cycling Weekly wrote "you can never write the three-time Flanders winner off in a race like this." The other former winners present at the start were Alexander Kristoff (Team Katusha), the defending champion, and Cancellara's teammate Stijn Devolder. Kristoff's strong sprint gave him an advantage if he was in a group that finished together; he had, however, been ill in the previous week. Devolder, meanwhile, was expected to work for Cancellara.
The other major favourite for the race was Peter Sagan (Tinkoff), the reigning world road race champion. Sagan had come second in E3 Harelbeke and first in Gent–Wevelgem. He had the advantage of being able to follow attacks and also to wait to use his strong sprint if he came to the finish with other riders.
Other riders with a chance of victory included Michał Kwiatkowski (Team Sky), who had won E3 Harelbeke ahead of Sagan and who had a strong team with Geraint Thomas, Ian Stannard and Luke Rowe; Greg Van Avermaet (BMC Racing Team); Boonen's teammates Niki Terpstra and Zdeněk Štybar; Sep Vanmarcke (LottoNL–Jumbo); and Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal).


== Race summary ==

Before the race began, there was a minute's silence in memory of Antoine Demoitié, a Wanty–Groupe Gobert rider who had been killed in a crash with a motorbike during Gent–Wevelgem. After 25 kilometres (16 mi), the riders arrived in Hooglede, the birthplace of Daan Myngheer, a rider for Roubaix–Lille Métropole who had died following a heart attack in the Critérium International; the peloton rode slowly through the town in memory of him.
The day's breakaway took a long time to form: over an hour into the day's racing, with more than 70 kilometres (43 mi) covered, a six-man move broke free. The riders were Hugo Houle (AG2R La Mondiale), Federico Zurlo (Lampre–Merida), Imanol Erviti (Movistar), Lukas Pöstlberger (Bora–Argon 18), Gijs Van Hoecke (Topsport Vlaanderen–Baloise) and Wesley Kreder (Roompot–Oranje Peloton). They earned a lead of over four minutes, but broke apart as the day's climbs began.
During the middle part of the race several riders were forced to withdraw after crashes. Arnaud Démare (FDJ), the winner of Milan–San Remo, crashed after 100 kilometres (62 mi), while Marcus Burghardt (BMC) and Tiesj Benoot crashed on the Wolvenberg shortly afterwards. Less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) later, several BMC riders crashed together and four were forced to withdraw. These included Greg Van Avermaet, who broke his collarbone.

On the Molenberg, with more than 110 kilometres (68 mi) remaining, a hard effort by Tony Martin (Etixx–Quick-Step) caused a split in the main peloton, with 25 riders in the front group, but the groups came back together shortly afterwards. André Greipel (Lotto–Soudal) and Nils Politt (Katusha) then attacked on the Leberg and were allowed to go; they were followed by Dmitriy Gruzdev (Astana) and Dimitri Claeys (Wanty–Groupe Gobert). These four riders joined up with Houle, Erviti and Van Hoecke from the original break; Houle was dropped soon afterwards to form a six-man leading group, which had a two-minute lead at the foot of the second ascent of the Oude Kwaremont. On the climb, Stijn Vandenbergh (Etixx–Quick-Step) and Dylan van Baarle (Cannondale) attacked from the peloton. Another group, including Sep Vanmarcke and Ian Stannard, attacked before the Koppenberg. Stannard then went solo over the top of the climb. Meanwhile, Vandenbergh and Van Baarle caught up with the group of leaders.
There were several more attacks before the climb of the Taaienberg, where a small group of favourites formed and quickly caught Stannard. Shortly afterwards, with 30 kilometres (19 mi) remaining, Michał Kwiatkowski and Peter Sagan attacked together and were joined by Sep Vanmarcke. They crossed the Kruisberg together and caught the remainder of the breakaway with 23.5 kilometres (14.6 mi) remaining, 40 seconds ahead of the peloton. On the final climb of the Oude Kwaremont, Kwiatkowski was unable to follow Sagan and Vanmarcke, while Cancellara rode clear of the peloton. Sagan was first to the summit with Vanmarcke; Cancellara was twelve seconds behind. Cancellara was then caught by Niki Terpstra, Erviti and Claeys.
On the final climb, the Paterberg, Sagan rode away from Vanmarcke, who was caught by Cancellara at the top of the climb. They rode in pursuit of Sagan, who had a 15-second lead at the summit. The chasing pair were unable to bring Sagan back and he rode to the finish to win his first Monument. Cancellara finished second, 25 seconds back, with Vanmarcke allowing him to take second place. Kristoff won the sprint for fourth place, ahead of Luke Rowe (Sky), 49 seconds behind Sagan.

== Post-race analysis ==


=== Rider reactions ===
Sagan celebrated his victory by doing a wheelie after the finishing line. He said afterwards that it was the hardest Tour of Flanders he had ever raced, having been "full gas" throughout and suggested that Cancellara had made a mistake by not following the attack he had made with Kwiatkowski and Vanmarcke. Cancellara was emotional after finishing his final Tour of Flanders. He said that he had "missed this one second", referring to the attack by Sagan. He said that he and Vanmarcke had done all they could in the chase, but that Sagan was too strong. Vanmarcke, meanwhile, said that he had struggled due to crashes in the middle part of the race and then had suffered cramp when Sagan attacked on the Paterberg. He described the move by Sagan and Kwiatkowski as the "decisive moment in the race".
Boonen, who finished fifteenth, described Sagan as "really strong" and as the "deserved winner"; he said "The way [Sagan] rode up the Paterberg was a good showcase on how to ride a bike". Boonen, meanwhile, turned his attention to Paris–Roubaix the following week. Van Avermaet described himself as "really disappointed" following his crash, which ruled him out of Paris–Roubaix. Luke Rowe's fifth place was Team Sky's best ever performance in the Tour of Flanders; he praised Kwiatkowski's move, but said "there’s not much you can do when someone has better legs"; he described Sagan, Cancellara and Vanmarcke as "the three strongest guys in the race". Imanol Erviti, who had been in the breakaway for 180 kilometres (110 mi), finished seventh. Cycling Weekly described this as "phenomenal"; it was Movistar's best ever result.
